# Geode security example - Client

This example demonstrates basic command security and user authentication in a client application
backed by a secured Geode cluster.

In this example, three data users with varying permissions attempt to read and write data
 in two regions.
The `dataReader` user has `DATA:READ` permission, `dataWriter` has`DATA:WRITE` permission, and
 `region1dataAdmin` has permissions `DATA:READ:region1` and `DATA:WRITE:region1`, but no permissions
 that apply to `/region2`.
(`region1dataAdmin` also has `DATA:MANAGE:region1` permission, but this permissions is unused
 in this example.)

This example assumes that Java and Geode are installed.

## Demonstration of Security
1. Set directory `geode-examples/clientSecurity` to be the current working directory.
Each step in this example specifies paths relative to that directory.

2. Build the example

        $ ../gradlew build

3. Start a secure cluster consisting of one locator with two servers hosting two regions with
 the script `scripts/start.gfsh`.
In this example, we use the security manager `org.apache.geode.examples.clientSecurity.ExampleSecurityManager`.
This security manager reads a JSON file that defines which roles are granted which permissions,
 as well as each user's username, password, and roles.
The JSON is present in `src/main/resources/example_security.json`.
For convenience, you can run this script with the command:

        $ ../gradlew start

4. Run the example.  Each user will attempt to put data to `/region1` and `/region2`,
 and then read data from `/region1` and `/region2`.  Unauthorized reads and writes throw
 exceptions caused by `NotAuthorizedException`, which we catch and print in this example.

        $ ../gradlew run

5. Stop the cluster using the script `scripts/stop.gfsh`.
For convenience, you can run this script with the command:

        $ ../gradlew stop

Refer to the `gfshSecurity` example to see how securing a cluster impacts `gfsh` commands.

## Things to Get Right with Security

- User authentication can be handled by any class that implements `SecurityManager`.

- Specify the `SecurityManager` by the `security-manager` property of all locator and server
property files.  Additional properties may be required by your choice of security manager -- for instance,
our implementation also requires `security-json` to be specified.

- Any class that implements `AuthInitialize` can handle the interaction between your Java code and
 the username and password passed to your `SecurityManager`.

- Refer to the documentation for explicit detailing of permissions required for each command.
